# Clustering algorithms

Clustering algorithms are unsupervised learning algorithms that group similar data points together based on their features or attributes.
The goal of clustering is to find structure in the data without any prior knowledge of the labels or classes.

There are several clustering algorithms available, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Here are some common clustering algorithms:

1)K-Means Clustering:
K-Means is a simple and popular clustering algorithm that partitions the data into k clusters, 
where k is a user-defined parameter. It works by iteratively updating the cluster centroids until convergence.

2)Hierarchical Clustering: 
Hierarchical clustering is a bottom-up approach that builds a hierarchy of clusters by recursively merging smaller
clusters into larger ones based on some similarity measure. This can result in a tree-like structure called a dendrogram.

3)Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN):
DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that groups together data points that are close to each other and 
separates points that are further apart. It works by defining a dense region as a cluster and identifying points that lie
in low-density regions as outliers or noise.

4)Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM):
GMM is a probabilistic clustering algorithm that models the data as a mixture of Gaussian distributions.
It assumes that each data point is generated by a particular Gaussian distribution and identifies clusters 
based on the parameters of the distributions.

5)Spectral Clustering: 
Spectral clustering is a graph-based clustering algorithm that uses the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a 
similarity matrix to cluster the data. It works by embedding the data into a low-dimensional space and then 
clustering the embedded data.
