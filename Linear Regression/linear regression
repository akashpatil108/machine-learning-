Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (also known as the response variable) and one or more 
independent variables (also known as predictors or explanatory variables). The goal of linear regression is to find a linear relationship between the predictor
variables and the response variable. The linear relationship is defined by a linear equation of the form:

y = β0 + β1x1 + β2x2 + ... + βpxp + ε

where y is the response variable, x1, x2, ..., xp are the predictor variables, β0, β1, β2, ..., βp are the coefficients or parameters of the model, and ε is
the error term that represents the variation in y that cannot be explained by the predictors.

The coefficients of the linear regression model are estimated using a method called least squares. 
The least squares method involves finding the line that minimizes the sum of the squared distances between the predicted
values of y and the actual values of y. This line is also known as the regression line or the line of best fit.

Once the coefficients of the linear regression model are estimated, they can be used to predict the value of the response variable for
new values of the predictor variables. The quality of the model can be assessed using measures such as the coefficient of determination (R-squared),
which represents the proportion of variation in the response variable that is explained by the predictors.

Linear regression has many applications in various fields such as economics, engineering, and social sciences. 
It can be used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables,
and to make predictions and inferences based on the model.
