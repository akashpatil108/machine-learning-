Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a type of supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. 
SVMs are powerful tools for solving linear and non-linear classification problems by finding the optimal hyperplane or decision boundary that
separates the data into different classes.

In SVMs, the goal is to find a hyperplane that maximally separates the data into different classes. The distance between the hyperplane and the 
closest data points from each class is called the margin. The SVM algorithm finds the hyperplane that maximizes the margin, which ensures that 
it is as robust and generalizable as possible.

In cases where the data is not linearly separable, SVMs can still be used by applying kernel methods. The kernel function maps the data into a 
higher-dimensional feature space where it may be linearly separable. This makes it possible to separate the data into different classes using a 
hyperplane in this higher-dimensional space.

SVMs have several advantages, such as their ability to handle high-dimensional data, their robustness to outliers, and their ability to generalize
well to new data. However, they can also be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets. Additionally, the choice of the kernel function
and its parameters can greatly affect the performance of the SVM algorithm.
